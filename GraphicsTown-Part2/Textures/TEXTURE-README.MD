# Custom Grass Texture Info

- The custom grass texture was created from scratch using Paint.NET 4.0

- I started with the rectangle tool to establish the size and ratio of the texture

- Next I filled it with a light green color before adding distortion effects

- Using the image noise adjustment tool, I increased the noise distortion intensity to 81 and reduced the color saturation to 65 to create the desired texture
